1.- Import the dataset.
2.- Convert it to Spark with all its attributes.
3.- Explore the dataset (and make plots) to understand the dataset and its relations better.
4.- Make an item-based recommendation system.
5.- Classify and group similar songs together (the user chooses on the basis of what should 
the groupings be made). Create a visual interface on which the user can select its preferences 
in a Tinder-like format, progressively obtaining a closer fit to their likes and dislikes (from 
time to time a random song will be included to explore more genres and to avoid getting stuck 
on something specific). All the songs which the user has liked will be available in a separate 
window. The user will also be able to explore the classifications made by features such as genre 
or danceability.
6.- (Extra: improve the experience of the user by including the cover or the demo of the songs).
