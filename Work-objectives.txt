1.- Import the dataset.
2.- Explore the dataset (and make plots) to understand the dataset and its relations better.
3.- Make an item-based recommendation system.
4.- Classify and group similar songs together. Create a visual interface on which the user can 
select its preferences in a Tinder-like format, progressively obtaining a closer fit to their 
likes and dislikes (from time to time a random song will be included to explore more genres and
to avoid getting stuck on something specific).
5.- (Extra: improve the experience of the user by including the cover or the demo of the songs).
